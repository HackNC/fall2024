                <h2>Mentoring at a Hackathon</h2>
                <p>People come to hackathons to learn new things and build cool
                    stuff! Along the way, our hackers might run into technical
                    difficulties, and will need the help of those more experienced with
                    the technology they're working with. This is where our mentors come
                    in, our mentors will be an elite team of volunteers and corporate
                    sponsored devs standing by to help our hackers when issues
                    arise.</p>
                <p>If you sign up to be a mentor, we'll ask you what technologies
                    you are familiar with and will get you in touch with the hackers via
                    a system known as <em>HelpQ</em>. In HelpQ, both hackathon
                    participants and mentors will register in the system. Mentors will
                    be able to list their areas of expertise. Participants who need
                    assistance will submit a request, list the technologies that they're
                    using, provide additional details about their problem, and give
                    their location in the venue. Mentors will be able to see a
                    list of all available requests and choose participants who
                    need help in the mentor's areas of expertise. After helping a
                    participant, mentors can either mark the request as resolved
                    or return the request to the queue. </p>
                <p>Overall, it's a great experience as you help someone build
                    something wonderful, remember to <a href="https://hacknc.typeform.com/to/AOVWGN6E">sign up</a> if
                    you wish to volunteer as a mentor, and if you are affiliated with
                    one of our sponsors, please email us at <a href="mailto:sponsorship@hacknc.com">sponsorship@hacknc.com</a>
